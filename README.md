# Root Growth Simulation in Granular Media

## Overview
This project models how plant roots grow through soil by simulating their motion with plastic fibers inside a medium of brass cylinders.  
We studied how **fiber length, packing density, and grain composition** affect the bending and stability of the root-like structure.  

## Key Features
- **Experimental setup:** Built a step-motor-driven pulley system to insert fibers into granular media of different densities.  
- **Theoretical modeling:** Compared bending vs. friction forces to determine the critical fiber length for instability.  
- **Data analysis:** Used video tracking (Fiji/ImageJ) and curve fitting to measure displacement and quantify bending behavior.  

## Results
- Higher **packing density** or **longer fiber length** → easier bending.  
- Denser media and mixed grain compositions reduced root stability.  
- Identified three bending regimes: exponential, near-critical, and high-density.
